# Home Lab – Security & Network Engineering

# Goal
Build a mixed virtual/physical lab to practice network engineering and security operations, including monitoring, detection, and incident response.

# Lab Overview
- Physical devices: ___ (router, switch, firewall, etc.)
- Virtual machines: ___ (Wazuh server, Windows client, Linux server, etc.)
- Segmentation: ___ (e.g., internal LAN, DMZ, WAN)

# Tools & Technologies
- Wazuh / other SIEM
- Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.)
- Windows (10/11)
- Virtualization: Proxmox / KVM / VMware / VirtualBox
- Network tools: nmap, Wireshark, tcpdump

# Architecture
See `architecture-diagrams/` for:
- Overall network layout
- Internet-facing vs. sandboxed segments
- Logging / monitoring pipeline

# Configurations
See `configs/` for:
- Firewall rules
- Wazuh agent configs
- Network device configs (sanitized)

# Screenshots
- Lab dashboards
- Alerts
- Topology views

# What I Learned
- How to design and secure a small network
- How to deploy monitoring and logging end to end
- How to simulate and observe real world attacks safely
